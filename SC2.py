#A local health clinic is looking to add a quick BMI calculator to their website so that their
#patients can quickly input their height and weight and be given a number as well as their
#classification. The classifications are as follows:

# - Underweight: Less than 18.5 BMI
# - Normal Weight: 18.5 to 24.9 BMI
# - Overweight: 25 to 29.9 BMI
# - Obese: 30 or more BMI

#It is up to you to figure out the calculation for an accurate BMI reading and tying it to
#the right classification

#Code Here:
import math
w = float(input("Now input your weight (In Kilograms): "))
h = float(input("Hello! Please input your height (In Meters): "))
height = h ** 2
BMI = w / height
print(BMI)
if BMI > 30:
    print("You are obese")
elif BMI > 25 and BMI < 30:
    print("You are overweight!")
elif BMI > 18.5 and BMI < 25:
    print("You are normal weight!")
else:
    print("You are underweight!")
