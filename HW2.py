import math
#1. Print "Hello World!"
print ("Hello World!")
#2. Create three different variables with distinct names and values: one with an integer, one with a string, one with a boolean.
test = 1200000000
Test2 = "TenBillionRabbits"
Test3 = True
Test4 = False
Space = " "
#3. Print all three variables on the same print function (at the same time).
print (test, Space, Test2, Space, Test3, Space, Test4)
#4. Create a variable that asks the user to input an integer.
X = int(input("Enter a number: "))
#5. Add the integer variable from #2 with the integer from #4 and print the result.
z = test + X
print (z)
#6. Take the result from #5 and divide it by 2. Print the result.
print (z/2)
#7. Change the value of the boolean variable to the opposite value (if true then make false, or vice versa).
Test3 = False
Test4 = True
#8. Print the value of the boolean variable.
print (Test3, Test4)
#9. Create a variable with a number that contains decimals.
variable = 10.1
#10. Round the number from #9 up or down using the round function.
print (" ")
print (variable)
print ("rounded is")
print (round(variable))
