#1. Create a for loop with variable i that counts down from 5 to 1 and then prints "Hello World!"
#at the end.
for b in range(5,0,-1):
    time.sleep(0.7)
    print(b)
else:
    time.sleep(0.7)
    print("Hello World!")
#2. Create a for loop that counts up and prints only even numbers between 1 and 30.
for b in range(1,31,+1):
    if b % 2 == 0:
        print(b)
    else:
        continue
#3. Create a for loop that prints from 1 to 30 and continues (skips the number) if the number is
#divisible by 3.
for b in range(1,31,+1):
    if b % 3 == 0:
        continue
    else:
        print(b)
#4. Create a for loop that prints 5 different animals from a list.
t = ["Cow","Pig","Crow","Dog","Dolphin"]
for a in t:
    print(a)
#5. Create a for loop that spells out a word you input backwards.
#(HINT: Google "How to reverse a string in Python")
for d in input("Phrase to Reverse?")[::-1]:
    print(d)
#6. Create a list containing 10 integers of your choice and print the list.
y = [6,3,34,9,4,2,1,10,100,10]
print(y)
#7. Create two empty variables named evenNumbers and oddNumbers.
evenNumbers = (0)
oddNumbers = (0)
#8. Make a loop that counts the number of even and odd numbers in the list, and prints the
#result after the loop.
for u in y:
    if u % 2 == 0:
        evenNumbers += 1
    else:
        oddNumbers += 1
print(evenNumbers,oddNumbers)
#9. Create a variable that asks the user for an integer and an empty integer variable.
H = (1)
Back = int(input("I REQUIRE AN INTEGER NOW!!!!!!!!"))
#10. Create a loop with a range from 1 to the number the user input. Use the loop to find the
#factorial of that number and print the result. A factorial of a number is that number multiplied
#by every number before it until you reach 1. (For example: 5! is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120)
for W in range(1,Back+1):
    H *= W
print(H)
